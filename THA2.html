        Respected Ma'am,
    </p>
    <p>
        I would like to bring to your notice that <b>Devsnest</b>, a mentorship organization, is organizing a <i>30 Days code camp </i>, i.e, 1 June 2021 - 30 June 2021. I attended this camp last year during my summer vacations and was overwhelmed by the quality of knowledge I gained during this short time.  The code camp will enrich the students with the knowledge of Data Structures and algorithms(DSA). Some of the remarkable features of this are provided below:
            <ul >
                <li>New Coding Challenges Everyday</li>
                <li>Questions range across various difficulties and 21 DSA topics</li>
                <li>Ideal for new programmers as well as experienced</li>
                <li>Develop a habit of coding</li>
            </ul>
                

I would request you to grant our batch the permission to attend the above mentioned.<br>
Camp will be held virtually on Discord, a real time chat platform.<br><br>
